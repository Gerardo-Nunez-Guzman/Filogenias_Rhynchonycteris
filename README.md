# Phylogenetic tree of *Rhynchonycteris naso*
This study proposes an integrative phylogenetic analysis of the genus *Rhynchonycteris*, as recommended by Lim et al. (2008). This approach aims to examine intraspecific variation and population structure, thereby contributing substantially to understanding the evolutionary history, biogeography, and conservation of Emballonuridae bats within the context of Neotropical biodiversity

## MATERIALS AND METHODS

An integrative phylogenetic approach was employed to reconstruct the evolutionary relationships among species within the studied group by combining mitochondrial and nuclear gene sequences alongside robust statistical methods. Mitochondrial gene sequences (COI and Cytb) and nuclear gene sequences (Chd1, Dby, and Usp9x) corresponding to *Rhynchonycteris naso* and the outgroup *Cyttarops alecto* were retrieved from the NCBI database using the EDirect toolkit in FASTA format. To ensure data consistency and minimize errors during analysis, all sequences were manually curated to standardize taxonomic
nomenclature. Multiple sequence alignment was then performed using MUSCLE v3.8.31, optimizing the identification of homologous regions across samples
